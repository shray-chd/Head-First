Create a program with a following scenario.
 
Engineer and Tester are two different kind of employee.
They have their name ,fname lname, age in yrs., total experience and tools/language
They both will do coding but their coding will be on different tool/language.
Engineer will code on more than one tool.
 
 
Case 1: When I ask tester which tool he has used, it should print tools name.
Case 2: If ask engineer tool he has used it should print tool(s).
Case (3) If ask tools and years of experience it should print tool(s) name.
Case (4): If ask engineer name of tool and total number of experience, it should return number of yrs. of experience on that tool.
If any of the info is not available or is not matching we will throw an exception.
(Assumption, tool1 you can consider exp as 1yr, tool 2 -> exp 2 yrs, tool3 -> exp 3).
 
Whichever method you feel comfortable with, use that. Make it modular and use concepts of oops.
 
Once then then do it for one tester and one engineer, do it for 5 engineers.
 
No collections to be used. It is based on the stuff you have already read.
